Thanks for the clarification! Here's the updated version with the correction that the deployment is triggered by changes to the repository as a whole, not just the `hello_world.py` script:

# Serverless App

This project facilitates the deployment of a serverless HTTP application using AWS Lambda and API Gateway resources.

A remote backend has been configured through the Terraform backend module, utilizing an S3 bucket for state storage.

### Automated Deployment Process
Whenever changes are made to the repository, a Terraform deployment is automatically triggered, deploying to either the production or test/dev environment based on the branch.

When a pull request is created targeting the `main` branch, GitHub will execute the Terraform stages (`init`, `plan`, and `apply`) in the test environment. It will then verify if the API endpoint is functioning correctly. Afterward, the environment is destroyed as part of the cleanup process. This ensures that any test environment created during the PR process is ephemeral.

If all checks pass successfully, you will be able to merge your changes into the `main` branch, which deploys the application to the production environment.

### Additional Checks and Automation
For every branch, additional checks are run, including:
- Linting and formatting of all Python and Terraform files.
- Documentation generation for the Terraform modules using `terraform-docs`.
- Unit testing for the `hello_world.py` script to ensure proper functionality.

### Benefits of Using This Approach
- **Streamlined Deployment**: Any change to the repository triggers an automatic deployment to the relevant environment, reducing manual overhead.
- **Environment Consistency**: Deployments to both test and production environments are automated, ensuring uniformity across environments.
- **Ephemeral Test Environments**: Test environments are created and destroyed automatically with pull requests, ensuring minimal resource usage.
- **Continuous Validation**: Automated checks ensure code quality through linting, formatting, unit testing, and documentation generation.
- **Easy Customization**: The project is designed to make adding new Lambda functions and customizing configurations simple, with minimal user input.

### Advantages of Using Terraform Modules
- **Modularity**: Terraform modules provide a reusable and maintainable approach to infrastructure, enabling easy integration and updates.
- **Simplified Configuration**: The project allows for quick deployments with minimal configuration changes, making it easy to expand or modify.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform ensures that infrastructure is versioned, consistent, and reproducible across all environments.

### Manual Deployment of a New Lambda Function

To manually deploy a new Lambda function, follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites
- Terraform v1.3.9
- Precommit version

1. **Create a folder** inside `lambda_function_files` that contains your Python Lambda function. The folder name should match the Python file name. For example:
   ```
   lambda_function_files/hello_world/hello_world.py
   ```

2. **Maintain Consistency**: To keep the project structure consistent, create a directory in the root folder with the name of your environment and copy the files from the `test` environment. Then, update the `main.tf` module to override any hardcoded values as needed.

3. **Deploy using Terraform**: Once the structure is in place, you can deploy the function using the basic Terraform commands:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

This will deploy your Lambda function to the specified environment.

This version now correctly reflects that the deployment is triggered by changes across the repository, not just the `hello_world.py` script. Let me know if you need further revisions!
